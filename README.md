# FoodCycle: Bridging Hunger Through Surplus Sharing

# Brief Description:

FoodCycle is a website developed to support Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): 

Zero Hunger by promoting the reuse and redistribution of surplus food. The platform connects restaurants, grocery stores, event organizers, and households with nearby NGOs, shelters, and food banks that serve people in need.

The website allows donors to list excess edible food and notifies local recipients in real-time. It also includes features like food safety guidelines, pickup scheduling, and impact tracking to ensure transparency and hygiene.

By reducing food waste and improving food access, FoodCycle contributes to ending hunger, achieving food security, and promoting sustainable consumption.
